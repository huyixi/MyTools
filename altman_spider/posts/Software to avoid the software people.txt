A few years ago, many of the
Y Combinator B2B startups wrote tools for the developers in other
companies--metrics software, deployment software, monitoring software, build
software, development frameworks, etc.  The startups would want to meet
with the technology people at companies to sell their service.
There's been a significant shift--lots
of the YC B2B startups are now building software to help non-technical people
in companies (usually large ones with a primary business that is not writing
software) avoid their internal IT department when they need software to help
them get something done.  It's faster and easier.  So now the
startups are trying to avoid the developers at the other company (so they don't
get blocked) and sell to the person who is waiting in the internal development
queue.  
It will be interesting to see how
far this trend goes, and something to keep in mind if you’re starting a new
company.
